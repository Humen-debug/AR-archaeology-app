## ðŸš€ Run locally

- Node version is lower than 17 because the Expo Cli in this project does not support Node version 17+. You can use [Node Version Manager (nvm)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/).
- The app has been migrated from Realm api to our own [server and apis](https://github.com/Humen-debug/XR-archaeology-server/tree/main). Before running the app, please create a `.env` file and configure the server api uri as `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL`. After running the server, the connection URI should be your **hosting device IP with port _3002_**.

1. Clone this project to your local environment
```
git clone "https://github.com/Humen-debug/XR-archaeology-app.git"
```
2. Configure the node version tp 16.xx.x, if your current node version is larger or equal to 17
```
nvm use 16
```
3. Install required packages
```
yarn
```
4. Enable developer mode and connect your tester device
  - Android: <https://developer.android.com/codelabs/basic-android-kotlin-compose-connect-device#0>
  - iOS: <https://getupdraft.com/blog/how-enable-ios-developer-mode-iphone-or-ipad>
5. Depending on your development environment run 
```
yarn android
```
or 
```
yarn ios
```

### Remarks

- `yarn start` has been duplicated by the `yarn android` and `yarn ios` because ViroReact does not support the Expo Go client.
- if you are developing using Android, after running `yarn clean`, please rollback the Android Linking of ViroReact in the `android` directory, by the [ViroReact Installation Instructions](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/installation-instructions), or using source controls in Git to revert the changes in `android` directory.
- If you want to run the app with a database with official data, don't hesitate to contact @Humen-debug to get the public API URL.
